    <h2>Tristan Parkinson</h2>
    <h2>Formido Oppugnatura Exsequens</h2>
    <p>In case anyone was wondering, the nickname is in latin.
    Currently I am pursuing a career in both cybersecurity and an author, also I am single.
    I am writing a book right now, and writing is one of my hobbies along with video games.
    Adding HTML to the list of languages I know is one of the reasons I took this class.
    My actual nickname is Trifle, but I want to see if someone will notice it down here.
    Even in the bio section, F.O.E.! If you get this reference, please comment where it's from.
