    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Here at Claret Hollows we on the 6th Stratum team own up to our reputation of a brutally difficult
    white water rafting experience. Our rental equipment prices are as 
    unbeatable as the experience itself.</p>
    <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our intended audience is for elite white water rafters who need a 
    death defying challenge to truly feel alive. We recognize that locations 
    similar to ours are banned to the public for saftey reasons, which is why 
    we are looking for those who waiver away any right to sue us for death or 
    other injuries that are likely to occur. With officials breathing down our necks, 
    we charge a hefty premium price for a hefty premium opportunity. On your journey, 
    you may see fellow rafters resting in peace with the chance to join them too. 
    The way most of our guests sign up is on a desktop computer.</p>

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
